<* FUN with pointers *>

<* including std -> print *>
inc "examples/std.frs";

<* We define a, b and c with there own value 5, 10 and 15 *>
val a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;


<* Just prints value of ´a´ *>
print (a);

<*
  With ´$´ we get the register index (which is also the memory position)
  of our variable, in this case ´a´. By adding 1/2 to our register index
  and then using ´~´ to get the value of the register, we get the value
  of ´a´ & ´b´
*>
print (~($a + 1));
print (~($a + 2));
